{"name":"Developer Community","tagline":"","body":"### Simple website to help facilitate a developer community.\r\nThis site was created to try and get a feeling of community for developers that work together in a company.  It has a section where users can submit ideas on what they'd like to do at the next community meeting.  Then users can vote and use that to determine what the next meeting will cover.  There is also a section where users can submit stories (think slashdot or hacker news).  The benefit being that users can then comment on how it directly impacts them without worrying about divulging proprietary information to the entire world as it will remain on a company intranet.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
